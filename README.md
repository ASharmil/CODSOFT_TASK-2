# CODSOFT_TASK-2
codsoft "DATA SCIENCE " : Successfully completed my TASK 2 during my internship period.
The Iris flower classification task is a classic machine learning problem where the goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on their sepal and petal measurements. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the task:

Dataset: The dataset typically includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for several iris flowers, along with their corresponding species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

Objective: The objective is to build a machine learning model that can predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements (multi-class classification problem).

Data Preprocessing:

The dataset is usually clean and ready to use, requiring minimal preprocessing.
Data normalization or standardization may be applied to ensure all features are on a similar scale, especially if different measurement units are used.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understanding the distribution of each feature and how they relate to each iris species.
Visualizing data using scatter plots, histograms, or pair plots to identify patterns and correlations between features.
Model Selection:

Choosing appropriate algorithms for multi-class classification tasks, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, or neural networks.
Initial model selection may involve comparing baseline performance of different algorithms.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model on one set and evaluate its performance on unseen data.
Using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess how well the model classifies iris flowers into their respective species.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimizing model performance by tuning hyperparameters (e.g., regularization strength in logistic regression, tree depth in decision trees) using techniques like grid search or randomized search.
Model Deployment:

Once a satisfactory model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to predict the species of new iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.
Interpretability:

Understanding which features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) contribute most to predicting each iris species can provide insights into the characteristics that distinguish one species from another.
Continuous Improvement:

Iteratively improving the model by revisiting data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, and tuning based on performance metrics or new data.
The Iris flower classification task is often used as a starting point for learning classification techniques in machine learning due to its simplicity, clear objective, and readily available dataset. It serves as a foundation for understanding data handling, model selection, evaluation, and deployment in practical machine learning applications.
